## How to use special keywords

Each factoid in BirbaBot can have at maximum 3 different definitions, like bar1, bar2 and bar3.
Special keywords just works for the first key definition "bar1".

The keywords are:

1) $nick | $who  (addressing)
2) <reply> see   (recursion)
3) <action>      (ctcp action)
4) "|" or "||"	 (random)

What do they do?

1)

"$who" or "$nick" get evaluated and substituted with the nickname of the person who asked the factoid.
The factoid must have ONLY one definition (bar1) for it to work. bar2/3 which contain such variables
will be told without interpolation.

EXAMPLE:

@kw new hello is hello $who!

asking: !hello
outputs: hello roughnecks!

2)

The word "see" operates like a recursion and it is transparent to the user.
The factoid's value must always begin with the keyword "<reply> see" and the factoid must have ONLY
 one definition (bar1) for it to work.

EXAMPLE:

@kw new hi is <reply> see hello
@kw new hello is Hello, how are you today?

asking: !hi
does a query against "hi" -> finds a "<reply> see" tag followed by "hello" -> does a new query against "hello" 
outputs: Hello, how are you today?

3)

The keyword <action> triggers the bot to spit a factoid while doing a "ctcp action".
The factoid's value must always begin with the keyword "<action>" and the factoid must have ONLY
 one definition (bar1) for it to work.

EXAMPLE

@kw new smile is <action> lols :)
asking: !smile
the bot performs a ctcp action
outputs: * Birba lols :)


QUOTING

Normally, the word 'is' is considered a separator between the keyword and the definition. 
In some case, you may want to include this word in the keyword. In this case you must quote the definition with "".

EXAMPLE

@kw new "what time is it" is I don't know
asking: !what time is it
bot replies: I don't know

Without quoting you would get 'what time' => 'it is I don't know' 

4)

You can store facts with random choices, even if not all the possible combinations work.
Usage is different when using single and double pipes..

EXAMPLE: double pipes

@kw new list is <reply> $nick: You can download a lot of free software here http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/multi-arch/iso-cd/debian-7.0.0-amd64-i386-netinst.iso !||<reply>$nick: Debian è un sistema operativo composto di software libero. Vedi http://www.debian.org/intro/free.it.html per sapere di più.||<reply>$nick: http://packages.debian.org/

That is: option1||option2||option#n

EXAMPLE: single pipe

@kw new wtf is <reply> (What|Who|Where|Why|When) The Fuck

randomness is given by specifying choises in parenthesis, separated by a single pipe.
You can put other text before and/or after the fact's random part; in this case we only have "The Fuck" after a random.
