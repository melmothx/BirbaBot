Examples of this are 2.6 kernels and ALSA on Woody - if you really want bleeding edge, use Sarge or Sid, don't pretend Woody with backports is still "stable".

Boot the installer with `linux debian-installer/allow_unauthenticated=true' or drop to a shell, chroot /target, kill the existing aptitude process and add the latest key, then run aptitude and install what you like.  This can be caused by using an out-of-date installation media (which doesn't have the latest archive key), or if you hit a mirror that is incompletely updated.

mbf ,,, Mass Bug Filing.  http://www.debian.org/doc/developers-reference/beyond-pkging.html#submit-many-bugs
openjdk ,,, <reply>OpenJDK is the open source release of <Java> from Oracle America (formerly Sun Microsystems).  All required functionality (according to the J2SE spec) is present, but some optional stuff is missing and some stuff uses different implementations from Oracle's binary JDK.

suexec ,,, a wrapper for executing CGI scripts as the user that owns the script rather than as the web server daemon.  See the apache2-suexec-custom package for a way of building a suexec wrapper that is more flexible than the default apache2 implementation.
xorg hal ,,, <reply>From Debian 6.0 "Squeeze" onwards, Xorg uses <hal> for configuration.  You can configure your mouse pointers etc without having to restart X and you don't need to configure the keyboard layout for console and X separately.  This vastly reduces the amount of code duplication between kernel and Xorg which reduces the amount of "bloat"; why should Xorg try to work out what devices are attached when the kernel already knows?
oneko ,,, an entertainment application involving a cat and mouse (pointer), packaged for Debian.  Not to be confused with <neko>.  http://www.daidouji.com/oneko/
uswsusp ,,, <reply>Debian 6.0 "Squeeze" users: remove the uswsusp package and use pm-hibernate/pm-suspend from the pm-utils package instead.  In Lenny, uswsusp was a package for userspace software <suspend>, including the s2ram and s2disk programs.  Use of <initramfs> is required.  Not available for Squeeze due to Debian bugs #498917, #503337,  #521147, #528483.  http://suspend.sf.net/

Upgrading from Debian 5.0 "Lenny" will offer you to chainload GRUB 2 from GRUB Legacy to verify its use, see §4.7.1 of the <squeeze release notes> for more information.  GRUB Legacy remains packaged, ask me about <grub legacy>.
cool uris don't change ,,, <reply> When fiddling with your server, remember that people will have bookmarks to your existing pages, other pages will have links and search engines will have your current set of pages indexed.  Don't dump people at a 404 page and say "please update your bookmarks", use a rewrite rule or similar to make life easy for everyone (see Apache's mod_rewrite for example).  http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI

xorg config ,,, <reply>From Debian 5.0 "Lenny" onwards, xorg mostly configures itself.  Resolution is set by your monitor/graphics card (unless they're broken), by your desktop environment or <xrandr>.  From Debian 6.0 "Squeeze", input hotplugging saves duplicating settings and restarting X after changes.  The /etc/X11/xorg.conf file is usually no longer needed and is often blank.  Manual configuration is still possible, see <xorg manual config>.

mttiw ,,, more trouble than it's worth
pyx ,,, a set of python libraries that are designed for making high quality plots of scientific data or equations.

Packaged for Debian in the python-pyx package.  See http://pyx.sf.net/ for examples and a gallery of plots.  Also ask me about <plotting>.
release goals ,,, <reply>Release goals are the list of things the Debian project wants to achieve prior to the next release.  See http://release.debian.org/wheezy/goals.txt for current goals and candidates, see http://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals for proposals.

parsing ls ,,, <reply>Trying to manipulate the output of "ls" isn't a very good idea at all: the output varies when you change locales or even between different versions of coreutils (let alone between linux and other unices).  The output of ls was never designed to be fed into other programs and if you have odd characters like spaces or newlines in your filenames then you will strike trouble.  See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs
eeebuntu ,,, <reply>Eeebuntu (not to be confused with Ubuntu Eee, now <easypeasy>) is a Linux distribution based on <Ubuntu> for use on netbooks.  It is not supported in #debian.  http://www.eeebuntu.org/  Support forum: http://forum.eeebuntu.org/  See also <based on debian>.

version epoch ,,, <reply> The version number of a package has a prepended number called the "epoch".  It is only added when the system for upstream version numbers changes.  Example: in sarge, X was version 6.8 but in etch it was 1.1 (xfree86->xorg).  But 1 < 6, so we add an epoch "2:" to signify that everything with 2: is newer (if there is no : the epoch is assumed to be "0").  See section 5.6.12 of <policy> or ask me about <compare versions> <debian revision>.
sabayon ,,, <reply>Sabayon Linux (formerly RR4 Linux, RR64 Linux) is a Live DVD <Gentoo>-based Linux distribution.  http://www.sabayonlinux.org/  #sabayon on irc.freenode.net.

(d) apt-get install apt; try again (e) apt-get install badpackage; try again (f) apt-get remove badpackage; apt-get install badpackage; try again (g) dpkg -r --force-depends badpackage; apt-get -f install; try again.
xorg config lenny ,,, <reply>In lenny, you can often use an <empty xorg.conf> but if you need to, you can use "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" to set your keyboard layout.  If you have further things you wish to configure, use "X -configure" ("X -configure :1" if server is already active) to produce a xorg.conf template.
story1 ,,, ok, so here's the story; i have no idea what i'm doing, i fucked it all up (it's FUBAR'd!), i can't explain it and will only confuse you if i try; but that sounds like fun, so here goes ...

python2.6 ,,, the default /usr/bin/python in squeeze.  If you need python2.6 for lenny, you can create a squeeze chroot with python2.6 in it; backporting python2.6 is unlikely to be successful due to changes in the module layout (around 600 packages had to be altered to upgrade from python2.5 to python2.6).

pci compliance ,,, <reply>Auditors for Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance often just check version numbers.  Debian carefully backports security fixes so you must convince your auditor that the version number does not tell all.  Check the specific CVEs they are interested in and ask me about <tracker of doom> to confirm they are fixed.  Also ask me about <security backports>.  You should be able to convince them their version number tests are "false positives".
modes ,,, <reply>Usually X autodetects the resolutions and display modes supported by your hardware; use <xrandr> to list and switch between them.  If autodetection fails or isn't good enough, you will need to create an <xorg.conf> and set the HorizSync/VertRefresh values for your monitor, and possibly add a Modeline.

unmixing ,,, <reply>You can't unmix releases.  Downgrading isn't supported by apt, by the maintainer scripts or the packages.

upstream-guide-games ,,, <reply>If you contact game <upstreams>, please point them at http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Games/Upstream
wheezy installer ,,, <reply>There is no "release candidate" (nor will there be) of Wheezy.  What has been released is a release candidate (testing version) of the wheezy _installer_.  This is probably the best thing to use for installing wheezy at the moment, but installing squeeze and dist-upgrading may be more successful.  See http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/News/2013/20130502  http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/ .  See also <wheezy errata>.

aptitude suffix ,,, <reply>The lowercase suffixes in braces {X} correspond to these actions: "Install", "Automatic", "Upgrade", "Downgrade", "Remove", "Purge", etc.  This list is certainly incomplete; see http://algebraicthunk.net/~dburrows/blog/entry/aptitude-0.4.10-released/ and the aptitude-doc search term reference.

netrunner ,,, <reply>Netrunner is an operating system based on <Kubuntu>.  It is not supported in #debian.  http://www.netrunner-os.com/
restart networking ,,, <reply>From squeeze onwards the use of the networking init script to reload networking configuration («/etc/init.d/networking restart») is discouraged.  Instead, perform the actions you really want.  Re-apply changes from /etc/network/interfaces: ifdown eth0; ifup eth0.  Remove all iptables rules: iptables -F.
ssh verify key ,,, <reply> To verify the fingerprint of a server's ssh key, you can run "ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key" on the remote machine.
ubuntards ,,, an offensive term used by ignorant people.

Replace "Shutdown" with "Reboot", "Suspend int32:1" or "Hibernate" as desired.

mouseemu ,,, a daemon to emulate mouse buttons on trackpads with only one button.
oldstable-proposed-updates ,,, <reply>oldstable-proposed-updates is a repository containing packages being prepared for the next <point release>.  They should be safe but are held back for wider testing before being accepted into the oldstable release at the time of the next point release.  http://www.debian.org/releases/proposed-updates http://release.debian.org/proposed-updates/oldstable.html .  See also <stable-proposed-updates>, <testing-proposed-updates>.
hard to use ,,, <reply> People say Debian is hard to use.  This is because Debian emphasizes freedom so you must enable the installation of non-free software, like <flash>.  See <overview>.

php5.4 ,,, <reply>php5.4 will be the version of <PHP> released in wheezy.  Remember that testing is a <moving target> and unsuitable for servers and that all php module packages and some application packages in squeeze will be incompatible with php5.4 meaning that providing backports of the package isn't feasible -- you can however make a backport yourself if you really want.  Ask me about <ssb>.  See also http://wiki.debian.org/PHP/54Transition
yaffs ,,, <reply>YAFFS is Yet Another Flash File System
netsurf ,,, <reply>NetSurf is a cross-platform web browser with <CSS> and Unicode support.  Not part of the Squeeze release due to Debian bug #574299.  http://www.netsurf-browser.org/

devkit ,,, a portable development environment, retargetable but machine-dependent.  The wrapping library is written in C and can be reconfigured to any target system.  The library is still unfinished but it is possible to code applications for any machine without source changes.  http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkit/
disable aaaa requests ,,, <reply>Unfortunately <eglibc> performs both ipv4 and ipv6 requests simultaneously, even if ipv6 is disabled.  Please see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/eglibc/+bug/417757/comments/288 for a "solution" to prevent AAAA requests from being made.
php paradox ,,, <reply>The PHP paradox is that the people running lenny with PHP 5.2 want to have PHP 5.3, while the people running squeeze with PHP 5.3 want to have PHP 5.2 or even PHP 5.4.  Meanwhile the wheezy users wished they had PHP 5.3.  Jokes aside, this is actually a sad indictment of both PHP and the applications written in it and the complete lack of design or thought that has permeated that language space since day one.
cherry ,,, <reply>ZF Electronics GmbH (formerly Cherry GmbH) is a German input peripheral manufacturer.  Debian Installer 6.0.0 does not support the use of Cherry USB keyboards during installation (Debian bug #584973), this was corrected at <6.0.1>.
testing sources.list ,,, <reply>Using "testing" instead of the current codename (e.g. squeeze) in your sources.list isn't as bad as using stable in your sources.list; you will just seamlessly continue to track the "testing" distribution following a release.  Note that for a few months just after a release, testing can be a pretty bumpy ride... perhaps running stable would be a better idea?  See also <stable sources.list>.
squeeze->wheezy ,,, <reply>Debian 7.0 "Wheezy" is almost ready!  In /etc/apt/sources.list, change "squeeze" to "wheezy" (noting that <wheezy-backports> have changed on the mirrors).  apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get dist-upgrade.  Also read the almost finished upgrading chapter in the <wheezy release notes>.  See also <squeeze->wheezy failures>.

wheezy pool ,,, <reply>See <wheezy pool 1> for bets placed on when Wheezy will release.  To add one, ask me about <wheezy bet>.

lightweight ,,, <reply><mjg59> To a first approximation, when someone says "Lightweight" what they mean is "I don't understand the problems that the alternative solves". (http://mjg59.livejournal.com/136274.html)
squeeze mysql ,,, <reply>Following an upgrade from lenny to squeeze, the "mysql-server-5.1" package is often not installed as a replacement to "mysql-server-5.0".  "aptitude install mysql-server-5.1"; you may also need to update any customisations to your server configuration from 5.0 to 5.1 -- one common problem is the inclusion of the no-longer-supported "skip-bdb" option in my.cnf which leads to the daemon failing to start (and dpkg and apt complaining).
mit-scheme ,,, <reply>MIT/GNU Scheme is an implementation of the <Scheme> programming language.  Packaged for Debian as mit-scheme, currently limited to the i386 architecture (Debian bug #365530).  http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/

nopointer ,,, <reply>On systems with the Intel 855GM integrated graphics chipset, a regression in linux-2.6 2.6.32-31 (part of the <6.0.1> point release) renders the mouse pointer invisible in X, also affecting video overlays (Debian bug #618665).  This issue was fixed at linux-2.6 2.6.32-32 (part of the <6.0.2> point release).
mk-build-deps ,,, a script in the <devscripts> package that creates a package called "yourpackage-build-deps" that depends on the <build-dep> packages; combining this with apt's <autoremove> feature allows you to remove build-deps after you have installed them.
missing images ,,, <reply>Not all Debian CD/DVD images are made available for download due to space considerations on mirrors.  If required, use jigdo to produce these using a Debian mirror; ask me about <jigdo> and <mirrors>.  http://www.debian.org/CD/faq/#not-all-images
sudo path ,,, <reply>As of sudo version 1.8.2 (wheezy/sid), sudo does not include /usr/sbin and /sbin in the PATH.  You must set secure_path in /etc/sudoers (as prompted by dpkg during the upgrade); see Debian bug #639841: Defaults secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"

geo http sources.list ,,, <reply>To have <APT> automatically select a mirror geographically close to you, you can use a Geo-IP service from http.debian.net.  An example line for your sources.list is "deb http://http.debian.net/debian/ squeeze main".  See http://http.debian.net/ for more information.  Unlike <cdn.debian.net>, it is safe to use with Google DNS etc because it uses HTTP 302 redirects.  See also <which http.debian.net>.

wine-unstable ,,, <reply>The wine-unstable packages in Debian are very out of date and possibly not what you want.  For unofficial, newer versions of these packages for wheezy/sid, see http://dev.carbon-project.org/debian/wine-unstable/ .  These packages can be backported to squeeze with a little work, ask me about <ssb>.  Alternatively, the commercial <cxoffice> offers a recent wine with support.
vbox-install wheezy ,,, <reply>From wheezy (and squeeze-backports) onwards, the virtualbox-ose-* packages have been renamed to virtualbox-* as the "OSE" vs "non-free" split no longer exists.

immediate configuration ,,, <reply> When upgrading from squeeze to wheezy, apt may stop with "E: Could not perform immediate configuration on '$package'." First, try running apt-get upgrade; .  If that fails, try running apt-get dist-upgrade -o APT::Immediate-Configure=0; instead.  Finally, if that doesn't work, if $package isn't an Essential package, then "dpkg -r $package; apt-get -f install.  You should also read <release notes>.
