## dpkg/#debian Bot database Import Utility
dpkg_facts-import.pl

This Utility can be used to import the factoids table from the mysql database of "dpkg",
an IRC bot which runs in freenode/oftc #debian channels, to the sqlite database of BirbaBot.

## How it works

First you need to setup a mysql database and import dpkg's data.

A nightly exported dump of dpkg's db can be found at: http://crito.ucr.edu/~dpkg/
Save it to disk and gunzip it.
Import apt_dump in your mysql databse like:

$ mysql -u user -p dbname < apt_dump

Then you need to stop BirbaBot, copy its sqlite db (birba.db) into this same dir where
this README is located.

Finally edit "dpkg_facts-import.pl" and set the custom variables for the sql connection handles.
Make the script executable if it's not and run it:

$ ./dpkg_facts-import.pl

Copy the updated birba.db back to the root of BirbaBot, start the bot.

** note #1

If you added some facts before running the importer, they will not be overwritten and you'll see
a failed execution query, like this:
DBD::SQLite::st execute failed: column key is not unique at ./dpkg_facts-import.pl line 48.

*** note #2

If this is the second (or ahead) time you are about to upgrade dpkg factoids, you may need to 
remove the old ones first. Open a sqlite shell on birba.db and execute this command:

sqlite> delete from factoids where nick='dpkg';

Then you can continue with the import process, as explained above.

## dpkg/#debian Bot database Save-To-Disk Utility
dpkg_facts-save.pl


This Utility can be used to import the factoids from the mysql database of "dpkg",
an IRC bot which runs in freenode/oftc #debian channels, to a text file.
The purpose is having a clean source to (eventually) parse.

## How it works

Data is taken from a mysql db as with the Import Utility seen before.
You need again to prepare a mysql database from the apt_dump file,
touch a "dpkg_facts" file in this very same directory and edit the
script filling the database credentials.

Then you can launch the script:

$ ./dpkg_facts-save.pl

Each line of the "dpkg_facts" text file will be formatted as follow:

keyword ,,, value

I used "3 commas" as separator between keys and values because it should grant 
enough safety when parsing the content of values (i don't think you would find 
some value containg 3 consecutive commas (at least i hope).

## dpkg/#debian Bot database Export-From-Disk Utility
dpkg_facts-export.pl

This utility can be used to export previously saved data by dpkg_facts-save.pl into 
the BirbaBot sqlite database.
Its purpose is using a text file which can be edited/parsed before starting the export.

## How it works

The dpkg_facts saved to disk with the previus utility is read line by line and factoids 
are saved back to a sqlite db.

You need to stop BirbaBot, copy its sqlite db (birba.db) into this same dir where
this README is located and prepare the dpkg_facts file, always in this directory.

Once you have the (maybe parsed) source file - dpkg_facts - and the destination db file,
you can launch the utility:

$ ./dpkg_facts-export.pl
